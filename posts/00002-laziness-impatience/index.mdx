Larry Wall (Programming Perl) said that there are three virtues of a programmer: Laziness, impatience and hubris.

Impatience can be rude if it’s directed at individuals, but paired with laziness is wonderful when you direct it at processes and decisions.

Generally, people need guidance on how to figure it out and focus on what's important.

We, engineers, automate so that we can focus on the fun stuff - and the fun stuff is the work that uses most of your brain, and it’s not something you can do for hours and hours, day after day.

So be impatience to figure out the nut of what’s important. Any time you see something being done that feels inefficient, question it: Why does this feel inefficient to me? What is the value in the thing we are doing? Can we deliver that value faster? Can we strip down this project into something simpler and get it done more quickly?

## What's the meaning of faster

“Faster” is not about “the same number of hours but fewer total days”. This just only means giving your free time to work.

“Faster” is about “the same value to the company in less total time”.

## Few words on burnout

Go home! And stop emailing people at all hours of the night and all hours of the weekend! Forcing yourself to disengage is essential for your mental health.

This isn’t only preventing your own burnout, but your teams too.

When you send those emails at all hours, people think it’s important. That overwork makes them less effective.

You might find yourself needing to work more hours to get it all done. That’s OK for a little while. Figure it out a way to work those hours without encouraging your team to do so. Queue up the weekend and overnight emails for the next workday.

Constantly ask yourself: Can I do this faster? Do I need to be doing this at all? What value am I providing with this work?
